1. What is machine learning: 
   1. Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (1959, Arthur Samuel)
   1. Well-posed learning problem: a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. (T, E, P)
   1. supervised learning; unsupervised learning.
1. Supervised Learning
   1. Housing price prediction: **regression problem**;
   1. Breast cancer (Tumor size - malignant/benign): **classification problem**
   1. support vector machine:  for infinate attributes
1. Unsupervised Learning
   1. **clustering algorithm**: find the stuctures in the (large) given data set;
   1. **non-clustering algorithm**: the cocktail party algorithm
   1. Octave/matlab to start, then migrate to C++ or Python
